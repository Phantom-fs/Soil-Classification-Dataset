# Soil-Classification-Dataset

This repository contains comprehensive datasets for soil classification and recognition research. The **Original Dataset** comprises soil images sourced from various online repositories, which have been meticulously cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency. To enhance the dataset's size and diversity, we employed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically the **CycleGAN** architecture, to generate synthetic soil images. This augmented collection is referred to as the **CyAUG Dataset**. Both datasets are specifically designed to advance research in soil classification and recognition using state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies.

### Abstract
<blockquote>
This study introduces an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for soil classification and crop recommendation, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in an ensemble approach, alongside an adaptive fuzzy logic-based decision system for crop suggestions. While existing research typically addresses soil classification or crop recommendation in isolation, this work integrates cutting-edge deep learning models and fuzzy logic to enhance both tasks. The methodology is divided into two phases: Phase 1 covers data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to expand the curated dataset of 1189 soil images to 8,413, while Phase 2 focuses on training CNN and ViT models, ensembling these models, and developing a fuzzy logic system that considers soil type, nutrients, potential of hydrogen (pH), and climatic conditions for crop recommendations. Experimental results indicate models achieve classification accuracies of up to 89.32 % on the original dataset, improving to 91.01 % with augmented data. On the CycleGAN-augmented (CyAUG) dataset, EfficientNet v2 Large and ViT-Large/16 attain accuracies of 99.60 % and 99.73 %, respectively. Furthermore, an ensemble of these architectures achieves a perfect accuracy of 100 %. The results are also validated by K-fold cross-validation. The research also presents 'Agro Companion,' an AI-powered tool that assists farmers in soil identification and crop selection based on geological and environmental data. This framework addresses key agricultural challenges in India, offering a high-accuracy, practical solution for improving both soil classification and crop recommendation. This research delivers state-of-the-art soil classification performance and a robust AI-based crop recommendation tool to support sustainable agricultural practices.

## Dataset

Both dataset consists of images of **7** different soil types. 

The **Soil Classification Dataset** is structured to facilitate the classification of various soil types based on images. The dataset includes images of the following soil types:

- **Alluvial Soil**
- **Black Soil**
- **Laterite Soil**
- **Red Soil**
- **Yellow Soil**
- **Arid Soil**
- **Mountain Soil**

The dataset is organized into folders, each named after a specific soil type, containing images of that soil type. The images vary in resolution and quality, providing a diverse set of examples for training and testing classification models. More specifically, the structure of the dataset is as follows:

```text
Soil-Classification-Dataset/
    Alluvial Soil/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    Black Soil/
        image1.jpg
        ...
    ...
```

### Download

The dataset is also available to be downloaded from the following sites:

- **Kaggle:** Coming soon
- **HuggingFace:** Coming soon

## Dataset Details

Dataset statistics for the original and augmented datasets from the research paper are as follows:

| Soil Type | Original Dataset | CyAUG Dataset|
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Alluvial Soil | 52 | 837 |
| Black Soil | 255 | 1885 |
| Laterite Soil | 219 | 831 |
| Red Soil | 109 | 1430 |
| Yellow Soil | 69 | 1593 |
| Mountain Soil | 201 | 761 |
| Arid Soil | 284 | 1076 |
| **Total** | **1189** | **8413** |

NOTE: For the CyAUG dataset, the training set is further augmented using noise, rotation, and flipping techniques to enhance model robustness. The CyAUG dataset given here is without training set augmentation, for simplicity and ease of use. The training set augmentation can be done using the code provided in the [Agro Companion Modules](https://github.com/Phantom-fs/Agro-Companion-Modules). If you want the augmented version of the CyAUG dataset, please contact the repository owner.
